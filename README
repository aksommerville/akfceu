I'm trying to rewrite FCEU from version 0.98.13 to something clean and portable.
0.98.13 is the last version I'm aware of before the onerous ports to C++.
I want to maintain clear separation between the core emulator, general services, and host services.
Having ported this very code to Wii, Linux, and iOS (albeit sloppily), I know that the code itself is OK.
OK, but very dirty.
